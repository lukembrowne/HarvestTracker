## Description

How many tomatos did you harvest last summer? I don't remember either, but Cosecha will keep track of that for you.

Cosecha helps you:

-   Log the timing and amount of harvests coming out of your garden
-   Choose from many common crops and add your own
-   Organize your harvests with tags
-   Visualize how your harvests change over time with graphs
-   Optimize your garden, or just satisfy your curiosity
