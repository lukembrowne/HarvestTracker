## Description


How many tomatos did you harvest last summer? I don't remember either, but Cosecha will keep track of that for you.

Cosecha helps you:

- Log the timing and amount of harvests coming out of your garden
- Choose from many common crops and add your own
- Organize your harvests with tags
- Visualize how your harvests change over time with graphs
- Optimize your garden, or just satisfy your curiosity
